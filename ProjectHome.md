# Project Outline #

<a href='http://www.cs.rit.edu/~zjb/courses/mrp/project.html'>Project Writeup</a>

The project grade will be based on several factors, as follows:
<ul>
<li>Localization correctness and effectiveness (50/100)</li>
<li>Path planning correctness (75/65)</li>
<li>Path execution in the absence of obstacles (25/20)</li>
<li>Obstacle avoidance algorithmic correctness (50/35)</li>
<li>Path execution in the presence of obstacles (50/35)</li>
<li>Overall efficiency of execution (25/20)</li>
<li>Real-world experiment results and description thereof (above bullets assume simulation) (100)</li>
<li>The clarity and completeness of your report (note this will have some bearing on all the other bullets too; if I can't tell what you were trying to implement, it's hard to tell if it's correct!) (25)</li>
</ul>
